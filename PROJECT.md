# Esper Project Description

## Overview

Esper is a morphogenetic training platform that enables neural networks to autonomously evolve their architecture during training. Unlike traditional neural networks with fixed architectures, Esper-enabled models can detect computational bottlenecks and apply specialized adaptations in real-time, leading to more efficient and capable models.

## Technical Innovation

### Morphogenetic Architecture
- Models can modify their own structure during training
- Targeted capacity injection at identified bottlenecks
- Smooth transitions via alpha blending
- Zero training disruption through asynchronous compilation

### GNN-based Intelligence
- Graph Neural Networks analyze model state in real-time
- Strategic decisions with confidence quantification
- Safety regularization prevents harmful adaptations
- Multi-head attention for comprehensive analysis

### Production-Grade Infrastructure
- Comprehensive error recovery with circuit breakers
- Distributed caching and persistent storage
- Real-time monitoring and observability
- Kubernetes-ready deployment

## Use Cases

1. **Research Applications**
   - Architecture search automation
   - Efficient model scaling
   - Transfer learning optimization
   - Neural architecture evolution studies

2. **Production Applications**
   - Adaptive model serving
   - Resource-constrained deployment
   - Continuous model improvement
   - Domain adaptation

## Technical Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.12+, PyTorch 2.2+
- **GNN**: PyTorch Geometric, torch-scatter
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible)

## Differentiators

1. **Real-time Adaptation**: Unlike traditional NAS, adaptations happen during training
2. **Parameter Efficiency**: 10-100x more efficient than full model retraining
3. **Production Ready**: Complete infrastructure for deployment
4. **Safety First**: Built-in safety mechanisms prevent harmful adaptations
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and auditing

## Current Limitations

- Limited to supported layer types (Linear, Conv2d, BatchNorm, LayerNorm, Attention)
- Synthetic kernel generation pending (Phase 3)
- Single-node training (distributed support planned)

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 3 (In Progress)
- Generative kernel synthesis (Karn)
- Advanced compilation pipeline (Tezzeret)
- Architectural sculpting (Emrakul)

### Phase 4 (Planned)
- Distributed training support
- AutoML integration
- Custom layer type support
- Edge deployment optimization
