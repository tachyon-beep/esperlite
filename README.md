# Esper - Morphogenetic Training Platform

A neural network training system that enables autonomous architectural evolution through morphogenetic architectures.

## Overview

Esper is a revolutionary approach to neural network training that enables models to evolve their own architecture during training. Instead of static, pre-defined architectures, Esper uses **morphogenetic architectures** - neural networks that can autonomously detect computational bottlenecks and patch them by grafting specialized sub-networks called **Blueprints**.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Architecture Evolution**: Models can modify their own structure during training
- **Strategic Controller (Tamiyo)**: AI-powered system that analyzes models and identifies where improvements are needed
- **Generative Architect (Karn)**: AI system that continuously invents new architectural primitives
- **Zero Training Disruption**: Asynchronous compilation pipeline ensures training never stops
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Targeted capacity injection is dramatically more efficient than full model retraining

## Architecture

The system consists of 11 specialized components organized into three functional planes:

### Training Plane

- **Tolaria**: Training orchestrator
- **Kasmina**: Execution layer

### Control Plane

- **Tamiyo**: Strategic controller (AI policy network)
- **Simic**: Policy training environment
- **Emrakul**: Architectural sculptor

### Innovation Plane

- **Karn**: Generative architect (AI design network)
- **Tezzeret**: Compilation forge
- **Urabrask**: Evaluation engine
- **Urza**: Central library

### Infrastructure

- **Oona**: Message bus for inter-component communication
- **Nissa**: Observability and auditing platform

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd esperlite
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Create virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

5. **Start infrastructure services**

   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Code Quality Checks**

   ```bash
   # Format code
   black src tests
   
   # Lint code
   ruff check src tests
   
   # Type checking
   pytype
   ```

2. **Testing**

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   pytest --cov=src/esper --cov-report=html
   ```

3. **Infrastructure Management**

   ```bash
   # Start services
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   
   # Stop services
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
   
   # View logs
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f
   ```
