# Esper Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Esper Morphogenetic Training Platform consists of three functional planes:

### Training Plane
- **Tolaria**: Training orchestrator that manages the complete training pipeline
- **Kasmina**: Execution layer for dynamic kernel loading and execution

### Control Plane
- **Tamiyo**: Strategic controller using GNN-based policy networks
- **Urza**: Central library for kernel artifacts and metadata

### Innovation Plane
- **Tezzeret**: Compilation forge (Phase 3)
- **Karn**: Generative architect (Phase 3)
- **Oona**: Message bus for inter-service communication

## Key Components

### KasminaLayer
The core execution engine that enables morphogenetic behavior:
- GPU-optimized state management
- Real-time kernel loading and execution
- Alpha blending for smooth transitions
- Comprehensive error recovery

### Tamiyo GNN
Graph Neural Network for strategic decision making:
- Multi-head attention architecture
- Uncertainty quantification
- Safety regularization
- Temporal trend analysis

### Error Recovery System
Production-grade resilience:
- Circuit breakers for fault isolation
- Multiple recovery strategies
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Graceful degradation

## Data Flow

1. **Training Initialization**
   - Tolaria wraps PyTorch models with KasminaLayers
   - Initial state configuration
   - Service registration

2. **Forward Pass**
   - Input flows through morphogenetic layers
   - Dynamic kernel execution based on state
   - Telemetry collection

3. **Adaptation Decision**
   - Health signals sent to Tamiyo
   - GNN analyzes model state
   - Strategic decisions made

4. **Kernel Loading**
   - Urza provides kernel artifacts
   - KasminaLayer loads and validates
   - Smooth transition via alpha blending

## Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST for control operations
- **Asynchronous**: Redis pub/sub for events
- **Streaming**: WebSocket for real-time updates

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker
- Microservices architecture
- Service isolation
- Shared networking
- Volume persistence

### Kubernetes
- Horizontal scaling
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Health monitoring

## Security Considerations

- API key authentication
- Network isolation
- Secret management
- Input validation
- Safe kernel execution
