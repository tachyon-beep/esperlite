# HLD Architecture Principles & Patterns

This document captures the core principles, patterns, and design philosophy from the HLD.

## 7 Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Execution (Kasmina) isolated from strategy (Tamiyo)
- Innovation (Karn) decoupled from operations
- Compilation (Tezzeret) and Validation (Urabrask) fully asynchronous
- Each subsystem has single, well-defined responsibility

### 2. Zero-Disruption Training
- Primary training loop never blocked by expensive operations
- Blueprint compilation offloaded to background services
- Predictable training schedules preserved
- Model learning momentum maintained

### 3. Integrity First
- Rigorous multi-stage validation before production impact
- Automatic rollback upon instability detection
- Conservative defaults favoring stability
- Safety over aggressive adaptation

### 4. Evolutionary Design
- Continuous learning from operational outcomes
- Tamiyo and Karn learn from FieldReports
- Tezzeret and Urabrask improve their processes
- Architectural diversity preservation

### 5. Operational Transparency
- All modifications traceable to specific triggers
- Real-time observability of all assets
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Complete accountability

### 6. Phased Implementation
- Phase 1: Single-server validation
- Phase 2: Production-ready intelligence
- Future: Full distribution and enterprise hardening
- Progressive complexity approach

### 7. Designed for Extensibility
- Clear extension points throughout
- Swappable core components
- Policy/strategy pattern usage
- Framework-agnostic design

## Key Design Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Loose coupling via async messaging
- Complete system history through event sourcing
- Essential for async compilation pipeline
- Enables audit and replay

### State Machine Pattern
- Deterministic lifecycle transitions
- Explicit validation at boundaries
- Applied to Seeds, Blueprints, Kernels
- Prevents invalid state transitions

### Strategy Pattern
- Pluggable behaviors throughout
- Different grafting strategies
- Blueprint selection policies
- Compilation optimization tiers

### Observer Pattern
- Non-blocking telemetry streaming
- Multiple consumers per event
- Real-time system monitoring
- Decoupled metrics collection

### Hexagonal Architecture
- Core domain logic independent of infrastructure
- Highly testable morphogenetic algorithms
- Pluggable storage backends
- Clean separation of concerns

### Repository Pattern
- Abstract storage of all assets
- Pluggable backends (filesystem, S3, etc.)
- Consistent interface across components
- Version control capabilities

### CQRS Pattern
- Separate paths for commands and queries
- Optimized for different access patterns
- State changes vs. telemetry reads
- Scalable architecture

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevent cascading failures
- Especially for compilation/validation
- Graceful degradation
- System resilience

## Technology Stack Principles

### Core Runtime
- Python 3.12+ for scientific ecosystem
- PyTorch 2.7+ for dynamic graphs
- Pydantic for runtime validation

### Messaging
- Phase 1: Redis Streams (simplicity)
- Phase 2: Apache Pulsar (scale)
- Ordering guarantees essential
- Persistence required

### Storage
- PostgreSQL for metadata (ACID)
- S3-compatible for artifacts
- Redis for caching/volatile
- Clear separation by use case

### Protocol Standards
- JSON for debugging transparency
- Protobuf for production optimization
- OpenMetrics for monitoring
- OpenAPI for documentation

## Architectural Constraints

### In Scope
- In-training adaptation only
- Asynchronous compilation pipeline
- Policy-governed evolution
- Multi-architecture support
- Distributed coordination
- Comprehensive observability

### Out of Scope
- Global architecture search
- Weight-only adaptation
- Unsupervised discovery
- Real-time inference adaptation
- Cross-model knowledge transfer
- Hardware-specific compilation

## Safety Mechanisms

### Gradient Isolation
- Stable parameters protected
- Local learning contained
- Interface contracts preserved
- No global interference

### Validation Pipeline
- Static analysis first
- Compilation checks
- Runtime benchmarking
- Performance characterization
- Only then deployment

### Rollback Capability
- Checkpoint before changes
- Instant restoration
- Zero data loss
- Deterministic recovery

### Resource Limits
- Memory budgets enforced
- Computation time bounded
- Parameter count limits
- Prevent runaway growth
