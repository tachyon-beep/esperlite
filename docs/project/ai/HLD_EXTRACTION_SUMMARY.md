# HLD Extraction Summary

## What Was Done

I've extracted key information from the High Level Design document (`docs/project/HLD.md`) and organized it into focused reference documents in the AI working memory folder.

## Documents Created

### 1. HLD_KEY_CONCEPTS.md
- Core innovation and philosophy
- Seeds as fundamental unit of change
- Blueprint vs Kernel distinction
- 11-stage morphogenetic lifecycle
- Zero training disruption principle
- Three functional planes
- Performance targets and phases

### 2. HLD_COMPONENT_DETAILS.md
- Detailed breakdown of all 11 subsystems:
  - Tolaria (Training Orchestrator)
  - Kasmina (Execution Layer)
  - Tamiyo (Strategic Controller)
  - Karn (Generative Architect)
  - Tezzeret (Compilation Forge)
  - Urabrask (Evaluation Engine)
  - Urza (Central Library)
  - Simic (Policy Sculptor)
  - Emrakul (Architectural Sculptor)
  - Oona (Message Bus)
  - Nissa (Observability)
- Data flow patterns
- State management strategies

### 3. HLD_ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md
- 7 core principles
- Key design patterns
- Technology stack principles
- Architectural constraints
- Safety mechanisms
- Key metrics and targets

### 4. HLD_PHASE_B5_GUIDANCE.md
- Specific guidance for Phase B5 implementation
- Persistent storage requirements
- Asset management needs
- Observability infrastructure
- Message bus hardening
- Testing and migration strategies

## Key Insights Gained

### 1. Seeds Are Everything
The HLD makes it crystal clear that seeds are the fundamental unit of morphogenetic change. This validates our Phase B4 approach of using seed orchestration rather than traditional model surgery.

### 2. Zero Training Disruption is Paramount
The entire architecture is designed around the principle that the training loop must never be blocked. All expensive operations (compilation, validation, etc.) happen asynchronously.

### 3. Three-Phase Validation
Every adaptation goes through rigorous three-phase validation:
- Pre-Integration (isolation testing)
- Controlled Integration (gradual rollout)
- Final Determination (commit/rollback decision)

### 4. Separation of Concerns
Clear separation between:
- Execution (Kasmina) and Strategy (Tamiyo)
- Innovation (Karn) and Operations
- Compilation (Tezzeret) and Validation (Urabrask)

### 5. Phase B5 Priorities
Based on the HLD, Phase B5 should focus on:
- Persistent storage (PostgreSQL + S3)
- Asset lifecycle management
- Comprehensive observability
- Production-ready message bus
- State consistency and recovery

## How This Helps

1. **Clear Architecture Vision**: We now have the complete architectural blueprint readily accessible
2. **Aligned Implementation**: Our Phase B4 seed orchestration aligns perfectly with HLD principles
3. **B5 Roadmap**: Clear guidance on what infrastructure hardening should include
4. **Quick Reference**: Key concepts organized for easy lookup during development
5. **Consistency**: Ensures our implementation matches the original design vision

## Documents Updated

- README.md - Added HLD reference section
- WORKING_MEMORY.md - Updated with HLD documents and B4 completion
- CURRENT_STATUS.md - Updated to 80% complete
- REMEDIATION_BETA_STATUS.md - Added B4 completion details

## Archived

- Old NEXT_PHASE_B4.md (model surgery approach)
- Old PHASE_B4_DETAILED_PLAN.md (superseded by seed orchestration)

The AI working memory folder now contains all essential HLD information needed for continuing development, especially for Phase B5 infrastructure hardening.
