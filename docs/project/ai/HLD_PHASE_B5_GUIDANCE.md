# HLD Guidance for Phase B5: Infrastructure Hardening

Based on the HLD, Phase B5 should focus on production-ready infrastructure that maintains the core principles of zero training disruption and operational transparency.

## Key Areas from HLD

### 1. Persistent Storage (Section 5.3.5)
- **Metadata Store**: PostgreSQL 16+ for transactional support
  - Track complex lineage of Blueprints and Kernels
  - ACID compliance for consistency
  - Relational integrity for asset relationships

- **Artifact Store**: S3-compatible object storage
  - Store large binary artifacts (kernels, checkpoints)
  - Scalable, environment-agnostic
  - Support for tiered storage

- **Caching Layer**: Redis for volatile storage
  - Hot kernel metadata
  - Frequently accessed assets
  - GPU kernel cache coordination

### 2. Asset Management (Urza Enhancement)
From Section 7.1.7, Urza needs:
- ACID-compliant asset management
- Tag-based search capabilities
- Version control and lineage tracking
- Rich query interface for Tamiyo
- Asset lifecycle state management

### 3. Observability (Nissa Implementation)
From Section 7.1.11, comprehensive monitoring:
- Real-time metrics collection
- Historical analysis capabilities
- Anomaly detection
- Compliance reporting
- Complete audit trail

### 4. Message Bus Hardening
For production Phase 2 (Section 5.3.4):
- Transition from Redis Streams to Apache Pulsar
- Multi-tenancy support
- Geo-replication capabilities
- Built-in schema registry
- Tiered storage for messages

### 5. State Management & Consistency
From Section 6.3:
- Distributed state coordination
- Epoch-boundary synchronization
- Checkpoint management
- Recovery mechanisms
- State versioning

### 6. Safety & Validation Infrastructure
From Section 3.3:
- 100% rollback reliability
- Comprehensive audit logs
- Resource consumption limits
- Adversarial robustness
- Long-term stability guarantees

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (Core Infrastructure)
1. **Persistent Kernel Cache**
   - Move from in-memory to Redis/PostgreSQL
   - Implement eviction policies
   - Cache warming strategies
   - Distributed cache coordination

2. **Asset Lifecycle Management**
   - Blueprint versioning
   - Kernel lineage tracking
   - Retirement policies
   - Storage optimization

3. **Checkpoint & Recovery**
   - Automated checkpoint management
   - Fast recovery mechanisms
   - State consistency validation
   - Distributed checkpointing

### Medium Priority (Observability)
1. **Metrics Pipeline**
   - Prometheus integration
   - Custom morphogenetic metrics
   - Performance dashboards
   - Alerting rules

2. **Audit System**
   - Event sourcing implementation
   - Compliance reporting
   - Change tracking
   - Security audit logs

3. **Debugging Tools**
   - Seed lifecycle visualization
   - Kernel performance analysis
   - Adaptation history browser
   - System health dashboard

### Low Priority (Future Scale)
1. **Multi-Node Coordination**
   - Distributed locking
   - Leader election
   - Consensus protocols
   - Partition tolerance

2. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-tenancy
   - Role-based access
   - Quota management
   - Cost tracking

## Key Constraints from HLD

### Performance Requirements
- Maintain <5% training overhead
- Sub-second kernel loading
- Minimal memory footprint
- Efficient state synchronization

### Reliability Requirements
- 99.9% uptime target
- Zero data loss
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic recovery

### Safety Requirements
- All changes auditable
- Rollback always possible
- Resource limits enforced
- No training disruption

## Testing Requirements

From Section 3.3, infrastructure must support:
- Deterministic reproduction
- End-to-end pipeline validation
- Fault injection testing
- Performance regression testing
- Long-term stability testing

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2 Transition**
   - Gradual migration from single-node
   - Backward compatibility maintained
   - Zero-downtime upgrades
   - Rollback capability preserved

2. **Data Migration**
   - In-memory → persistent storage
   - Format versioning
   - Integrity validation
   - Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

Infrastructure hardening complete when:
1. System survives node failures
2. State recoverable from any point
3. Performance targets maintained
4. Full observability achieved
5. Production deployment ready
