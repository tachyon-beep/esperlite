# Esper Morphogenetic Training Platform - AI Documentation

This directory contains the working documentation for AI-assisted development of the Esper platform.

## Current Status: Remediation Plan Beta - 100% Complete ‚úÖ

We have successfully completed Remediation Plan Beta, addressing all critical missing functionality. All five phases are now complete, and the system is production-ready.

## Completed Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase B1: Real Kernel Compilation Pipeline
- [Implementation Summary](./phases/PHASE_B1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Replaced placeholder kernels with actual TorchScript compilation
- Achievement: ~0.15s compilation latency

### ‚úÖ Phase B2: Async Support for Conv2D Layers
- [Implementation Summary](./modules/PHASE_B2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Enabled true async execution without blocking
- Achievement: Zero synchronous fallbacks

### ‚úÖ Phase B3: Intelligent Seed Selection
- [Implementation Summary](./phases/PHASE_B3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Replaced hardcoded seed selection with multi-armed bandit framework
- Achievement: < 1ms selection latency

## All Phases Completed

### ‚úÖ Phase B4: Dynamic Architecture Modification via Seed Orchestration
- [Implementation Summary](./phases/PHASE_B4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Implemented through Kasmina seed mechanism, not traditional model surgery
- Achievement: < 500ms modification latency

### ‚úÖ Phase B5: Infrastructure Hardening
- [Implementation Summary](./phases/PHASE_B5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- Production-ready infrastructure with persistent caching and monitoring
- Achievement: <30s recovery, 98% cache hit rate, <5% training overhead
