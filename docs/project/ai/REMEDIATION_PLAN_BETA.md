# Remediation Plan Beta: Addressing Missing Functionality

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive remediation plan ("Beta") to address critical missing functionality identified in the Esper morphogenetic training platform. The plan is organized into distinct phases (B1-B5) with clear deliverables, success criteria, and integration points.

## Executive Summary

The Esper platform has achieved significant milestones with Phase 1 (real kernel execution) and Phase 2 (GNN-based policy system) largely complete. However, several critical components remain as placeholders or are not yet implemented. This remediation plan addresses these gaps to achieve production readiness.

4. **Dynamic architecture modification** (currently raises NotImplementedError)
5. **Persistent kernel cache** (currently in-memory only)

### Progress Status:
- Phase B1: Real Kernel Compilation Pipeline - **COMPLETED** ✅
