# Test Suite Modernization - Phase C5

## Overview

This document describes the test suite modernization work completed as part of Remediation Plan Charlie (Phase C5), focusing on reducing mock usage, improving test quality, and ensuring tests verify real functionality rather than implementation details.

## Principles

### 1. Minimal Mocks
- Only mock external dependencies (Redis, HTTP services)
- Use in-memory implementations for internal components
- Real components catch integration issues early

### 2. Production Code Integrity
- Only change production code when it deviates from specification
- Contracts (Pydantic schemas) define expected behavior
- Tests should adapt to implementation, not vice versa

### 3. Value-Focused Testing
- Only keep tests that verify meaningful functionality
- Remove tests that exist solely for coverage
- Tests should verify behavior changes, not method calls

## Implementation Summary

### Phase C5: Test Suite Modernization

#### 1. Removed Autouse Mocks
**File**: `tests/conftest.py`
- Changed `mock_http_client` and `mock_oona_client` from autouse to opt-in
- Tests must now explicitly request mocks when needed
- Prevents automatic mocking that hides integration issues

#### 2. Created Real Test Infrastructure
**Files**: `tests/fixtures/test_infrastructure.py`, `tests/fixtures/real_components.py`

##### InMemoryPerformanceTracker
```python
class InMemoryPerformanceTracker(PerformanceTracker):
    """In-memory implementation for testing without Redis."""
    
    async def get_seed_metrics(self, layer_name: str, seed_idx: int) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Returns real metrics stored in memory
    
    async def record_seed_metrics(self, layer_name: str, seed_idx: int, metrics: Dict[str, float]):
        # Stores metrics in memory for test verification
```

##### InMemoryBlueprintRegistry
```python
class InMemoryBlueprintRegistry(BlueprintRegistry):
    """In-memory blueprint management for testing."""
    
    def register_template(self, name: str, template: Dict[str, Any], metadata: BlueprintMetadata):
        # Stores blueprints in memory instead of filesystem
```

##### TestKernelFactory
```python
class TestKernelFactory:
    """Creates real kernel artifacts for testing."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_real_kernel(input_size: int, output_size: int) -> Tuple[bytes, KernelMetadata]:
        # Creates real TorchScript kernels with metadata
```

#### 3. Refactored test_seed_orchestrator.py

**Original Test (Heavy Mocking)**:
```python
def test_initialization(mock_performance_tracker, mock_blueprint_registry):
    orchestrator = SeedOrchestrator(...)
    assert orchestrator.performance_tracker == mock_performance_tracker
    # Just verifies mocks were stored - no real value
```

**Refactored Test (Real Components)**:
```python
async def test_seed_performance_affects_modification_strategy(
    self, orchestrator, test_model, real_performance_tracker
):
    # Record real performance metrics
    await real_performance_tracker.record_seed_metrics(
        "layer1", 0, {"accuracy_trend": 0.9, "loss_trend": 0.1}
    )
    
    # Test actual behavior change based on metrics
    plan = orchestrator._create_modification_plan(decision, layer, seed_analysis)
    assert plan.strategy == SeedStrategy.DIVERSIFY
    # Verifies strategy changes based on real performance data
```

#### 4. Fixed Production Code Issues

**Bug Found**: `seed_orchestrator.py` used non-existent `is_seed_active()` method
```python
# Before (incorrect):
is_active = kasmina_layer.state_layout.is_seed_active(seed_idx)

# After (correct):
active_seeds_mask = kasmina_layer.state_layout.get_active_seeds()
is_active = active_seeds_mask[seed_idx].item()
```

**Telemetry Made Optional**: KasminaLayer can disable telemetry for tests
```python
KasminaLayer(128, 256, num_seeds=4, telemetry_enabled=False)
```

## Results

### Before Modernization
- 354 mock occurrences across 26 test files
- Autouse fixtures automatically mocked all external calls
- Tests verified mock interactions, not real behavior
- Production bugs hidden by excessive mocking

### After Modernization
- Seed orchestrator tests use real components
- All 7 refactored tests pass
- Found and fixed production bug
- Tests verify actual behavior changes
- Codacy analysis shows no issues

### Test Quality Improvements

1. **More Reliable**: Tests use real components, catching integration issues
2. **Faster Feedback**: No need for external services in most tests
3. **Better Design**: Tests focus on behavior, not implementation
4. **Cleaner Code**: Less mock setup boilerplate

## Remaining Work

### High Priority Files to Refactor
1. `test_kasmina_layer.py` - Core execution layer tests
2. `test_kernel_cache.py` - Caching logic tests
3. `test_tamiyo_client.py` - Policy client tests
4. `test_oona_client.py` - Message bus tests

### Types of Tests to Remove
1. Tests that only verify mock behavior
2. Tests checking if a method was called
3. Tests for trivial getters/setters
4. Tests that exist only for coverage metrics

### Additional Infrastructure Needed
1. In-memory message bus for Oona testing
2. Mock HTTP server for Urza/Tezzeret testing
3. Test data builders for complex objects
4. Fixture factories for common test scenarios

## Best Practices Going Forward

### When to Use Mocks
- External services (Redis, HTTP APIs)
- File system operations in unit tests
- Time-sensitive operations
- Non-deterministic operations

### When to Use Real Components
- Internal service interactions
- Business logic verification
- Integration testing
- Performance characteristics

### Test Structure
```python
# Good: Tests behavior
async def test_cache_evicts_least_recently_used(real_cache):
    # Add items to fill cache
    for i in range(cache.max_size):
        await cache.add(f"key_{i}", f"value_{i}")
    
    # Access first item to make it recently used
    await cache.get("key_0")
    
    # Add one more item
    await cache.add("key_new", "value_new")
    
    # Verify LRU item was evicted
    assert await cache.get("key_1") is None
    assert await cache.get("key_0") == "value_0"

# Bad: Tests implementation
def test_cache_calls_eviction_method(mock_cache):
    mock_cache.add("key", "value")
    mock_cache._evict_lru.assert_called_once()
```

## Metrics

### Coverage Impact
- Coverage may decrease initially as low-value tests are removed
- This is acceptable - quality over quantity
- Focus on branch coverage of critical paths

### Performance Impact
- Real component tests run slightly slower than pure mocks
- Still fast enough for CI/CD (< 2 seconds for test suite)
- Integration tests provide more value despite slower execution

## Conclusion

The test suite modernization successfully demonstrates that tests can be both maintainable and valuable by:
- Using real components where possible
- Focusing on behavior verification
- Removing low-value coverage-only tests
- Fixing production issues found during refactoring

This approach results in a more reliable, maintainable test suite that provides confidence in the system's actual behavior rather than just its mock interactions.
