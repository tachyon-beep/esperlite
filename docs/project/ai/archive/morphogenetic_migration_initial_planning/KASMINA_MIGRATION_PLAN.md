# Kasmina Migration Plan: From Current to Target Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased migration strategy to evolve the current Kasmina implementation toward the sophisticated design specified in the v0.1a specification. The migration preserves backward compatibility while incrementally introducing performance optimizations and architectural improvements.

## Current State vs Target State

### Current Implementation
- Simple morphogenetic layer with basic seed management
- 5-stage lifecycle with direct kernel loading
- Sequential processing without GPU optimization
- Direct telemetry collection

### Target Design
- Chunked architecture with thousands of seeds per layer
- 11-stage lifecycle with comprehensive safety gates
- High-performance Triton kernels with parallel processing
- Asynchronous message-based telemetry via Oona
