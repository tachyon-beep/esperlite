# Phase 0 Status: Foundation & Preparation

## Overview
Phase 0 of the morphogenetic migration has been initiated as of 2024-01-24. This phase focuses on establishing the foundation and infrastructure needed for the 11.5-month migration journey.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Migration Infrastructure
- Created `src/esper/morphogenetic_v2/` directory structure
- Established separate namespaces for Kasmina, Tamiyo, and common components
- Set up initial module structure with version tracking

### 2. Feature Flag System
- Implemented comprehensive feature flag manager in `common/feature_flags.py`
- Support for:
  - Global enable/disable
  - Percentage-based rollout
  - Model-specific allowlists/blocklists
  - Environment variable overrides
- All features currently disabled (Phase 0 state)

### 3. Performance Baseline Framework
- Created `PerformanceBaseline` class for measuring current system metrics
- Tracks key metrics:
  - Forward pass latency (mean, P50, P95, P99)
  - Throughput (samples/sec)
  - GPU/CPU memory usage
  - Morphogenetic-specific metrics
- Comparison tools for regression detection

### 4. A/B Testing Framework
- Implemented `ABTestRunner` for comparing implementations
- Statistical significance testing
- Support for multiple metrics:
  - Latency comparison
  - Accuracy preservation
  - Output similarity
- Automated winner determination

### 5. Regression Test Suite
- Created comprehensive regression tests in `tests/test_regression.py`
- Test cases for:
  - KasminaLayer backward compatibility
  - Tamiyo decision consistency
  - Lifecycle state transitions
- Automated comparison between legacy and new implementations

### 6. Configuration Management
- Created `config/morphogenetic_migration.yaml`
- Defines phase targets, team structure, and rollout strategy
- Monitoring and alerting configuration

### 7. Baseline Measurement Script
- Created `scripts/establish_morphogenetic_baseline.py`
- Automated baseline collection for multiple batch sizes
- Performance target validation

### 8. API Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation in `CURRENT_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Covers KasminaLayer, Tamiyo, and all data classes
- Deprecation timeline and migration guide included
- Breaking changes clearly identified

### 9. Monitoring Infrastructure
- Created Grafana dashboards:
  - `morphogenetic_overview.json`: System performance metrics
  - `migration_progress.json`: Migration tracking dashboard
- Prometheus alerting rules in `morphogenetic_alerts.yml`
- Performance, migration, and operational alert categories

### 10. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/morphogenetic_migration.yml`
- Automated regression testing every 6 hours
- Performance benchmarking with regression detection
- A/B testing for feature branches
- Feature flag validation and safety checks
- Automated rollout gates

## Pending Tasks 📋

### 1. Run Initial Performance Baseline
- Execute baseline script on reference hardware
- Establish performance metrics for all phases

### 2. Complete Phase 0 Documentation
- Update all documentation with final Phase 0 status
- Prepare Phase 1 kickoff materials

## Metrics & KPIs

### Phase 0 Targets
- ✅ Infrastructure setup: 100% complete
- ✅ Feature flag system: Operational
- ✅ Test framework: Established
- ⏳ Baseline metrics: Pending execution
- ⏳ Team onboarding: In progress

### Current System Performance (Estimated)
- Forward pass latency: ~450ms (target: <100ms)
- Seeds per layer: 1 (target: 1000+)
- GPU utilization: ~45% (target: >80%)
- Implementation: Sequential (target: Parallel)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Run baseline performance measurements
2. Complete API documentation
3. Set up monitoring infrastructure
4. Begin team recruitment for GPU specialist

### Phase 0 Completion (Week 4)
1. All infrastructure operational
2. Complete test coverage of legacy system
3. Team fully staffed and trained
