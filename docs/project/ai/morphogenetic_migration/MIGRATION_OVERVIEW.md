# Morphogenetic System Migration Overview

## Purpose
This folder contains all documentation and planning materials for migrating the current Esper morphogenetic implementation to align with the original v0.1a design specifications for Kasmina and Tamiyo.

## Contents

### Design Specifications (Original Vision)
- `kasmina_design_v0.1a.md` - Detailed design for the Kasmina execution layer
- `tamiyo_design_v0.1a.md` - Detailed design for the Tamiyo strategic controller

### Alignment Assessments (Current vs Design)
- `KASMINA_ALIGNMENT_ASSESSMENT.md` - Analysis of current implementation vs design (30% aligned)
- `TAMIYO_ALIGNMENT_ASSESSMENT.md` - Analysis of current implementation vs design (45% aligned)

### Migration Planning
- `KASMINA_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Phased 11.5-month migration strategy
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Immediate action items and priorities

## Key Findings

### Current Implementation Status
The current implementation represents a functional but significantly simplified version of the original vision:
- Basic morphogenetic adaptation works
- Production-ready for current scope
- Missing sophisticated features from design

### Major Gaps to Address

#### Kasmina (30% aligned)
1. No chunked architecture (1 seed vs thousands)
2. No custom GPU kernels (standard PyTorch only)
3. Simplified lifecycle (5 vs 11 stages)
4. No message bus integration
5. Basic grafting only

#### Tamiyo (45% aligned)
1. Direct integration vs message bus
2. Heuristic-only (no neural controller)
3. No blueprint selection strategies
4. Missing Karn integration
5. Simplified configuration

## Migration Strategy Summary

### Phased Approach (11.5 months total)
- **Phase 0**: Foundation & Preparation (4 weeks)
- **Phase 1**: Logical/Physical Separation (6 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Extended Lifecycle (8 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Performance Optimization (10 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Message Bus Integration (6 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (8 weeks)

### Core Principles
1. **Incremental**: Each phase delivers value
2. **Compatible**: Backward compatibility maintained
3. **Monitored**: Continuous performance tracking
4. **Reversible**: Rollback capability
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive validation
