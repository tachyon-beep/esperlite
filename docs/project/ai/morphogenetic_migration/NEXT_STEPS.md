# Next Steps for Morphogenetic Migration

## Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Technical Assessment Deep Dive
- [ ] Profile current implementation performance baseline
- [ ] Identify critical code paths for optimization
- [ ] Map dependencies between components
- [ ] Assess GPU kernel development expertise needs

### 2. Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Present migration plan to technical leadership
- [ ] Get buy-in on resource allocation
- [ ] Establish success metrics with product team
- [ ] Create communication plan for users

### 3. Phase 0 Kickoff Preparation
- [ ] Set up migration team structure
- [ ] Create project tracking infrastructure
- [ ] Establish CI/CD pipeline enhancements
- [ ] Define feature flag framework

## Phase 0 Detailed Tasks (Weeks 3-6)

### Infrastructure Setup
```bash
# Create development branches
git checkout -b feature/morphogenetic-v2
git checkout -b feature/kasmina-chunks
git checkout -b feature/tamiyo-lifecycle

# Set up feature flags
export ESPER_KASMINA_V2_ENABLED=false
export ESPER_CHUNK_ARCHITECTURE=false
export ESPER_EXTENDED_LIFECYCLE=false
```

### Test Framework
1. **Baseline Tests**
   - Current functionality coverage
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Integration test suite

2. **Migration Tests**
   - A/B testing framework
   - Compatibility validators
   - Regression detection

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking

### Documentation Tasks
1. **API Documentation**
   - Current API reference
   - Deprecation notices
   - Migration guides

2. **Architecture Docs**
   - Current state diagrams
   - Target state diagrams
   - Transition plans

## Technical Spike Requirements

### 1. Triton Kernel Feasibility (Week 4)
```python
# Prototype simple Triton kernel for chunk processing
@triton.jit
def chunk_forward_prototype(
    input_ptr, output_ptr, 
    chunk_size: tl.constexpr
):
    # Validate performance gains
    pass
```

### 2. Message Bus Integration (Week 5)
- Evaluate Oona capacity for telemetry volume
- Prototype claim-check pattern
- Test latency requirements

### 3. State Tensor Design (Week 3)
- Prototype GPU-resident state management
- Test atomic update performance
- Validate memory requirements

## Risk Mitigation Planning

### High-Risk Areas
1. **GPU Kernel Development**
   - Mitigation: Hire GPU specialist consultant
   - Fallback: Optimized PyTorch implementation

2. **Message Bus Scalability**
   - Mitigation: Load testing early
   - Fallback: Hybrid direct/bus approach

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing
   - Fallback: Extended legacy support

## Decision Points

### Week 6 Go/No-Go Criteria
- [ ] Performance prototype shows >5x improvement potential
- [ ] Team resources confirmed for 11-month commitment
- [ ] No blocking technical constraints identified
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

### Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **Chunk Size Strategy**
   - Fixed vs dynamic sizing
   - Optimal chunk dimensions
   - Memory alignment considerations

2. **State Persistence**
   - Redis vs PostgreSQL for state
   - Checkpoint frequency
   - Recovery mechanisms

3. **Telemetry Transport**
   - Message size thresholds
   - Compression strategies
   - Batching policies

## Success Metrics Definition

### Performance KPIs
- Forward pass latency: <100Î¼s overhead
- GPU utilization: >80% during adaptation
- Memory overhead: <20% vs baseline
- Adaptation success rate: >95%

### Quality KPIs
- Test coverage: >95%
- Bug escape rate: <1%
- Documentation completeness: 100%
- API compatibility: 100%

## Communication Plan
