# Morphogenetic Migration Documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation Moved

The active morphogenetic migration documentation has been relocated to maintain better organization:

### Active Documentation Location
**‚û°Ô∏è `/working_memory/morphogenetic_migration/`**

This is where all current morphogenetic migration work is being tracked, including:
- Current status and progress
- Implementation reports
- Technical specifications
- Phase planning documents

### Archived Initial Planning
The initial planning documents from January 2024 have been archived to:
**üìÅ `/docs/project/ai/archive/morphogenetic_migration_initial_planning/`**

## Current Status (as of 2025-01-24)

- ‚úÖ **Phase 0**: Foundation (Complete)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Logical/Physical Separation (Complete)  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Extended Lifecycle (Complete)
- üöß **Phase 3**: GPU Optimization (Next)
- ‚è≥ **Phases 4-10**: Planned

## Note

This migration is separate from the Remediation Plan Beta (Phases B1-B5) which was completed earlier. The morphogenetic migration focuses on evolving the neural network architecture to support dynamic, self-modifying models.
