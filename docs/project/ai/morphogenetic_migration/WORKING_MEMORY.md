# Morphogenetic Migration Working Memory

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 0 - Foundation & Preparation (Week 1 of 4)
- **Date Started**: 2024-01-24
- **Progress**: 40% of Phase 0 complete

## Completed Tasks
- âœ… Migration infrastructure created (`src/esper/morphogenetic_v2/`)
- âœ… Feature flag system implemented
- âœ… Performance baseline framework created
- âœ… A/B testing framework implemented
- âœ… Regression test suite established
- âœ… Configuration management setup
- âœ… All planning documents created and approved

## Active Tasks
- ðŸ”„ Documenting current API for deprecation planning
- ðŸ“‹ Running initial performance baseline
- ðŸ“‹ Setting up monitoring dashboards
- ðŸ“‹ CI/CD pipeline enhancements

## Key Decisions Made
1. Using Triton for GPU kernels (Phase 3)
2. 11-stage lifecycle implementation (Phase 2)
3. Message bus integration via Oona (Phase 4)
4. $3.2M budget approved over 11.5 months
5. Team of 8 FTE average

## Technical Context
- Current alignment: Kasmina 30%, Tamiyo 45%
- Main gaps: No chunking, no GPU kernels, simplified lifecycle
- Performance target: 10x improvement (<100Î¼s latency)

## Important File Locations
- Migration code: `src/esper/morphogenetic_v2/`
- Configuration: `config/morphogenetic_migration.yaml`
- Documentation: `docs/project/ai/morphogenetic_migration/`
- Scripts: `scripts/establish_morphogenetic_baseline.py`

## Next Critical Path Items
1. Document current KasminaLayer API
2. Document current TamiyoAnalyzer API  
3. Run performance baseline measurements
4. Set up Grafana dashboards
5. Create CI/CD pipeline for migration

## Team Status
- Technical Lead: TBD (recruiting)
- GPU Specialist: TBD (high priority recruit)
- Current team: Solo implementation of Phase 0

## Risk Watch
- GPU hardware provisioning delays
- Lack of Triton expertise on team
- Baseline performance unknown
