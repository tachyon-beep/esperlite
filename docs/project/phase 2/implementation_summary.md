**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅

This document summarizes the Phase 2 implementation plan and the key systems to be built for the Esper Execution Engine.

## **Phase 2 Objective**

**Goal:** Prove that a host model can load and execute real, compiled artifacts produced by the Phase 1 pipeline with minimal performance overhead.

**Timeline:** 3 weeks (Weeks 7-9)

**Success Criteria:** End-to-end test demonstrating `Tezzeret -> Urza -> Kasmina` pipeline execution

## **Systems to be Implemented**

**Purpose:** High-performance execution layer that loads and runs pre-compiled kernel artifacts

**Key Components:**

  - GPU-optimized Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) layout
  - Seed lifecycle tracking (DORMANT, LOADING, ACTIVE, ERROR_RECOVERY)
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Error count and fallback state management

- **Kernel Cache** (`src/esper/execution/kernel_cache.py`)
  - LRU-based GPU-resident cache for compiled kernels
  - Configurable memory limits and entry count
  - Async kernel loading from Urza
  - Cache hit/miss statistics

- **Execution Engine** (`src/esper/execution/kasmina_layer.py`)
  - PyTorch nn.Module integration
  - Forward pass with kernel execution
  - Alpha blending for morphogenetic grafting
  - Telemetry collection and publishing
  - Graceful degradation to fallback execution

**Technical Specifications:**

- Target performance overhead: <5% for dormant seeds (MVP target)
- GPU memory optimization with tensor coalescing
- Microsecond-scale kernel execution latency
- Async/await support for non-blocking operations

### **2. Model Wrapping System**

**Purpose:** Seamless integration of morphogenetic capabilities into existing PyTorch models

**Key Components:**

  - `esper.wrap()` function for automatic layer injection
  - Configurable target layer selection
  - Preservation of original model weights and behavior
  - Deep copy of models to avoid modification

  - Lifecycle management methods
  - Comprehensive statistics collection

**Key Features:**

- Automatic detection and replacement of target layers

### **3. SDK Interface**

**Purpose:** Clean, high-level API for end-users

**Key Components:**

- **Main Module** (`src/esper/__init__.py`)
  - Clean public API surface
  - Version management
  - Logging configuration
  - Import organization

**Public API:**

```python
import esper

# Wrap a model with morphogenetic capabilities
morphable_model = esper.wrap(model, seeds_per_layer=4)

# Load a compiled kernel into a specific layer and seed
await morphable_model.load_kernel("layer_name", seed_idx=0, kernel_artifact_id="kernel-001")

# Execute model with morphogenetic kernels
output = morphable_model(input_tensor)
```

### **4. Integration and Testing Systems**

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation of the execution pipeline

**Key Components:**

- **Unit Tests**
  - State management and lifecycle transitions
  - Kernel cache LRU behavior and memory management
  - Model wrapping and layer injection logic
  - Telemetry collection and publishing

- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_phase2_execution.py`)
  - End-to-end execution pipeline testing
  - Performance overhead measurement
  - Error handling and graceful degradation
  - Cache functionality validation
  - Telemetry collection verification

- **Performance Validation**
  - Dormant seed overhead measurement
  - Cache hit rate optimization
  - Kernel loading latency benchmarks
  - Memory usage tracking

**Testing Strategy:**

- Kernel execution simulation for MVP (avoiding Phase 1 dependency)
- Real model wrapping with various PyTorch architectures
- Performance comparison with baseline models
- Error injection and recovery testing

## **Architecture Overview**

### **Data Flow**

```
PyTorch Model
     ↓
esper.wrap()
     ↓
MorphableModel + KasminaLayers
     ↓
Forward Pass → KasminaLayer.forward()
     ↓
Check Seed States → Load Kernels (if needed)
     ↓
Execute Kernels → Blend with Default Transform
     ↓
Publish Telemetry → Return Output
```

### **Component Relationships**

- **KasminaLayer** depends on **StateLayout** and **KernelCache**
- **ModelWrapper** creates and manages **KasminaLayer** instances
- **KernelCache** integrates with **Urza** for artifact loading
- **KasminaLayer** publishes telemetry via **Oona** message bus
- **Integration Tests** validate the complete pipeline

### **External Dependencies**

- **Phase 1 Services:** Urza (artifact storage), Oona (message bus)
- **PyTorch:** Core deep learning framework
- **Contracts:** Pydantic data models from Phase 1
- **Infrastructure:** Redis, PostgreSQL, MinIO (via Phase 1)
