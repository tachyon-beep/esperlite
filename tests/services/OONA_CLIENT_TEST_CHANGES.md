# OonaClient Test Refactoring

## Summary
Refactored test_oona_client.py to focus on behavior testing with minimal mocking of Redis internals.

## Key Changes

### Removed Tests
1. **test_init_success** - Low value, just testing constructor
2. **test_init_connection_error** - Merged with connection failure test
3. **test_publish_success/error** - Replaced with behavior-focused tests
4. **test_consume_success** - Replaced with integration test
5. **test_acknowledge_success** - Simplified to just verify the call
6. **test_health_check_success/failure** - Consolidated into behavior tests

### Test Improvements

1. **Message Publishing Tests**
   - Tests that messages maintain structure through serialization
   - Uses real HealthSignal objects for realistic payloads
   - Verifies JSON serialization of complex objects
   - Tests error handling during publishing

2. **Message Consumption Tests**
   - Tests parsing of consumed messages
   - Verifies consumer group creation behavior
   - Tests acknowledgment functionality

3. **Connection & Health Tests**
   - Tests connection failure handling
   - Tests health check in various states
   - Tests Redis URL from environment
   - Removed test for non-existent `publish_health_signal` method

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete publish-consume cycle test
   - Multiple consumer groups test
   - Simulates realistic Redis behavior

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Message serialization performance
   - Batch publishing simulation
   - Verifies sub-millisecond serialization

## Behavioral Focus

The refactored tests focus on:
- How messages flow through the system
- Serialization and deserialization behavior
- Error handling and recovery
- Consumer group management
- Performance characteristics

## Mocking Strategy

- Mock Redis client, not implementation details
- Simulate realistic Redis responses
- Track published messages for verification
- Test actual parsing logic
