# TamiyoClient Test Refactoring

## Summary
Refactored test_tamiyo_client.py to focus on real behavior testing rather than mocking implementation details.

## Key Changes

### Removed Tests
1. **test_mock_analyze_model_state_empty_signals** - Trivial test, behavior is obvious
2. **test_mock_analyze_model_state_healthy_layers** - Replaced with more comprehensive behavior test
3. **test_mock_status_and_health** - Low value, just testing return values
4. **test_mock_client_stats** - Low value, testing getter method
5. **test_analyze_model_state_success (with mocked response)** - Replaced with behavior-focused test
6. **test_analyze_model_state_empty_response** - Merged into other tests
7. **test_submit_adaptation_feedback_success** - Testing mocked success, not real behavior
8. **test_get_tamiyo_status_success** - Just mocking return values
9. **test_health_check_healthy/unhealthy** - Consolidated into single behavior test
10. **test_client_stats_tracking** - Low value initialization test
11. **test_reset_stats** - Trivial functionality
12. **TestTamiyoClientConfiguration class** - Low value config tests

### Test Improvements

1. **MockTamiyoClient Testing**
   - Tests actual decision generation logic based on health scores
   - Verifies urgency correlates with poor health
   - Tests processing delay simulation
   - Verifies feedback always succeeds (mock behavior)

2. **TamiyoClient Real Behavior**
   - Tests circuit breaker protection with real failure scenarios
   - Tests empty signals skip HTTP requests entirely
   - Tests successful request flow with realistic responses
   - Tests health check interpretation of various states
   - Tests statistics tracking during operation

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Tests graceful network error handling
   - Tests timeout behavior
   - Uses realistic error scenarios

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Tests concurrent request handling
   - Verifies stats collection has minimal overhead
   - Uses real timing measurements

## Behavioral Focus

The refactored tests focus on:
- How the client behaves under various conditions
- Circuit breaker protection mechanisms
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Performance characteristics
- Real decision generation logic

## Removed Mocking

- Removed excessive mocking of HTTP responses
- Only mock at integration points when testing specific behavior
- Test real methods and data flow where possible
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP) only when necessary
