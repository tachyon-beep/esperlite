### Key Success Metrics
- ✅ 100% Remediation Beta complete
- ✅ 40% Morphogenetic Migration complete
- ✅ 0 critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ 3,469 samples/sec performance (Phase 2)
- ✅ 2M+ samples/sec with GPU optimization (Phase 3)
- ✅ 150+ tests passing (Phases 0-3)
- 🚧 Phase 4 structure complete, integration pending

### Phase 4 Critical Issues to Address
1. **LifecycleManager instantiation error in handlers.py**
