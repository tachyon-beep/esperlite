### 2. Performance Baseline
- [ ] Run Phase 1 benchmarks on target hardware:
  - NVIDIA A100 or equivalent
  - Various batch sizes (32, 64, 128, 256)
  - Different seed counts (100, 1000, 5000, 10000)
- [ ] Compare with legacy implementation baseline
- [ ] Document any performance regressions
- [ ] Identify optimization opportunities

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with real model architectures
- [ ] Validate with existing training pipelines
- [ ] Ensure checkpoint compatibility
- [ ] Test with distributed training setup

## Week 1 Tasks

### Enable Limited Rollout
1. **Monday**: Enable for 1% of development models
   ```bash
   python scripts/enable_phase1_features.py --enable --rollout 1
   ```

2. **Wednesday**: Review metrics and logs
   - Check error rates
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Gather developer feedback

3. **Friday**: Increase to 10% if metrics positive
   ```bash
   python scripts/enable_phase1_features.py --enable --rollout 10
   ```

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure alerts for:
  - Error rate increases
  - Performance degradation
  - Memory usage spikes
  - Feature flag failures
- [ ] Create dashboard for Phase 1 metrics
- [ ] Set up automated rollback triggers

## Week 2-3 Tasks

### Gradual Rollout
- **Week 2 Start**: 25% rollout
- **Week 2 Mid**: 50% rollout
- **Week 2 End**: 75% rollout
- **Week 3**: 100% rollout (if all metrics positive)

### Documentation & Training
- [ ] Create developer guide for chunked architecture
- [ ] Document new APIs and interfaces
- [ ] Host team training session
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide

### Phase 2 Planning
- [ ] Review Phase 2 requirements
- [ ] Assess resource needs
- [ ] Plan extended lifecycle implementation
- [ ] Schedule design review meeting

## Month 2 Objectives

### Phase 1 Optimization
Based on production metrics:
- [ ] Optimize chunk size selection
- [ ] Tune state update batching
- [ ] Implement caching improvements
- [ ] Profile and optimize hot paths

### Phase 2 Implementation Start
- [ ] Implement extended 11-state lifecycle
- [ ] Add checkpoint/restore capabilities
- [ ] Enhance grafting strategies
- [ ] Build migration tools for state conversion

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Add Telemetry Export**
   - Prometheus metrics integration
   - OpenTelemetry tracing
   - Custom performance counters

2. **Enhance Error Recovery**
   - Automatic rollback on critical errors
   - Seed quarantine mechanisms
   - Recovery strategy selection

3. **Memory Optimization**
   - Dynamic chunk sizing
   - Lazy blueprint allocation
   - State compression for dormant seeds

### Medium Priority
1. **Developer Tools**
   - Seed visualization tool
   - Performance profiler integration
   - Debug mode with detailed logging

2. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Property-based testing
   - Stress testing framework
   - Chaos engineering tests

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation**
   - Architecture decision records
   - Performance tuning guide
   - Best practices document

## Risk Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Performance**
   - Forward pass latency (target: <5ms @ 1000 seeds)
   - Memory usage (target: <500KB @ 1000 seeds)
   - GPU utilization (target: >80%)

2. **Reliability**
   - Error rate (target: <0.01%)
   - Recovery success rate (target: >99%)
   - Rollback frequency (target: 0)

3. **Adoption**
   - Feature flag enablement rate
   - Developer feedback scores
   - Issue report frequency

### Contingency Plans

**If Performance Degrades**:
1. Reduce rollout percentage
2. Optimize hot paths
3. Consider Phase 3 acceleration

**If Errors Increase**:
1. Immediate rollback
2. Root cause analysis
3. Hotfix deployment

**If Memory Issues**:
1. Reduce chunk counts
2. Implement memory pooling
3. Add swap mechanisms

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- ✅ 100% rollout achieved
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Zero critical issues
- ✅ Positive developer feedback
- ✅ Phase 2 plan approved

### Ready for Phase 2 When:
- [ ] Phase 1 stable for 2 weeks
- [ ] Team trained on new architecture
- [ ] Resources allocated
