# Phase 3 GPU Optimization - Kickoff Status

*Date: 2025-01-24*

## Summary

Phase 3 of the morphogenetic migration has been successfully initiated. This phase focuses on achieving 10x performance improvement through custom Triton GPU kernels.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Planning & Documentation
- ✅ Restored comprehensive migration plan from archive
- ✅ Reviewed Phase 3 technical specifications
- ✅ Created detailed Phase 3 planning document
- ✅ Restored original Kasmina and Tamiyo design documents

### 2. Environment Setup
- ✅ Verified Triton installation (v3.3.1)
- ✅ Confirmed PyTorch 2.7.1 with CUDA 12.6
- ✅ Validated GPU availability (2x RTX 4060 Ti)
- ✅ Created Triton kernel directory structure

### 3. Initial Implementation
- ✅ Implemented `kasmina_forward_kernel` - Main forward pass kernel
- ✅ Created `state_update_kernel` - Batch state updates
- ✅ Created `telemetry_reduction_kernel` - Telemetry aggregation
- ✅ Built comprehensive test suite for kernels
- ✅ Fixed Codacy issues (removed trailing whitespace, unused variables)

## Technical Details

### Triton Forward Kernel Features
1. **Parallel Processing**: Each thread block handles one seed's chunk
2. **State-Based Execution**: Branch-free predication for GPU efficiency
3. **Multiple Grafting Strategies**:
   - Linear blending with configurable alpha
   - Multiplicative transformation
   - Additive transformation
4. **In-Kernel Telemetry**: Statistics computed without extra memory transfers
5. **Type-Safe Operations**: Proper integer conversions for indices

### Memory Layout
- Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) pattern for coalesced access
- 8 state variables per seed
- 4 telemetry values per seed
- Pre-allocated output buffers

### Performance Targets
- Forward pass latency: <100μs for 1000 seeds
- GPU utilization: >80%
- Memory bandwidth efficiency: >70%
- Zero CPU-GPU transfers during inference

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. Fix remaining Triton compilation issues
2. Run full kernel test suite
3. Implement kernel benchmarking
4. Profile GPU memory usage

### Week 1
1. Optimize kernel block sizes
2. Implement fused operations
3. Create integration with Phase 2 components
4. Set up NSight profiling

### Week 2-3
1. Memory pool management
2. Blueprint weight caching
3. Advanced kernel optimizations
4. Performance validation

## Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks
1. **Kernel Compilation Issues**
   - Status: Active - Working on type conversion fixes
   - Mitigation: PyTorch fallback maintained

2. **Memory Alignment**
   - Status: Not yet tested
   - Mitigation: 16-byte alignment enforcement planned

3. **Performance Unknowns**
   - Status: Benchmarking pending
   - Mitigation: Iterative optimization approach
