## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Successful Patterns Established

1. **ConfigDict Optimization**:

   ```python
   model_config = ConfigDict(
       arbitrary_types_allowed=True,
       use_enum_values=True,
       validate_assignment=True,
       extra="forbid"  # Performance boost
   )
   ```

2. **UTC DateTime Pattern**:

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, UTC
   created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC))
   ```

3. **Performance Testing Framework**:
   - Serialization benchmarks: <1ms requirement
   - Throughput tests: >1000 ops/s requirement  
   - Complex data structure validation

### Lessons Learned

1. **Test-First Approach**: Creating comprehensive tests before optimization reveals edge cases
2. **Gradual Migration**: UTC datetime migration requires careful coordination across modules
3. **Performance Validation**: Regular benchmarking catches regressions early
4. **Documentation**: Clear progress tracking enables efficient collaboration
